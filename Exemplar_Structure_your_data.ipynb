        "In this activity, you will practice structuring, an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** step that helps data science projects move forward. During EDA, when working with data that contains aspects of date and time, \"datetime\" transformations are integral to better understanding the data. As a data professional, you will encounter datetime transformations quite often as you determine how to format your data to suit the problems you want to solve or the questions you want to answer. This activity gives you an opportunity to apply these skills and prepare you for future EDA, where you will need to determine how best to structure your data.\n",

        "You will work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help you draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, you will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. This will develop your skills in EDA and your knowledge of functions that allow you to structure data.\n",

        "- Many of the unicorn companies that were founded in 2021 were founded in the United States and belong to \"Fintech\", \"E-commerce & direct-to-consumer\", and \"Internet software & services\" industries.\n",
        "- The box plot created shows that companies that become unicorns in the months of September and October have a smaller median value for how long it took to become unicorns.\n",
        "- One of the bar plots created shows that the average valuation of companies that joined in 2020 is highest in the third quarter of the year, whereas the average valuation of companies that joined in 2021 is highest in the first quarter of the year.\n",

        "**What recommendations would you share with stakeholders based on these findings?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- According to data analysis that was conducted on a dataset of 1074 unicorn companies, companies that joined in the months of September and October tended to take less time to become unicorns.\n",
        "- Another finding was that many of the unicorn companies that were founded in 2021 were founded in the United States and belong to \"Fintech\", \"E-commerce & direct-to-consumer\", and \"Internet software & services\" industries. So if the stakeholders want to invest in companies founded in 2021, it would be a good idea to consider companies that belong to these industries, as they may be strong candidates for becoming unicorns.\n",
        "- It was also discovered that the average valuation of companies that joined in 2021 is highest in the first quarter of the year, and the average valuation of companies that joined in 2020 is the third quarter of the year. When considering companies that newly join in the future, it would be worth closely looking at companies that join in the first and third quarters of the year.\n",
        "- The data can be analyzed further to gather more insights that are specific to the interests of the investing firm and the stakeholders."
